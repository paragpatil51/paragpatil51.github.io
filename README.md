##  Academic Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Loan Prediction System
Developed a machine learning-based solution to predict loan approval status based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount. Historical data was used to train models for classifying applications as approved or rejected. The system improves decision-making processes for financial institutions by offering data-backed predictions.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
- Model training using supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- Visualization of key insights using Tableau  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning Algorithms, Tableau

---

### ðŸ”¹ Big Mart Sales Prediction
Created a regression model to forecast sales of products across various outlets for a retail chain. The system enables data-driven inventory and marketing strategies by predicting sales based on product type, outlet size, location, and promotional offers.

**Key Highlights:**
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Used regression models to identify sales trends and correlations
- Enhanced retail decision-making through predictive analytics  
**Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

---

### ðŸ”¹ Automated Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Tool
Built an end-to-end data preprocessing pipeline that allows users to upload raw datasets and receive both a cleaned dataset and a trained machine learning model. The tool automates tasks such as handling null values, removing outliers, encoding, and model training.

**Key Highlights:**
- Interactive pipeline design for seamless user experience
- Automatically handles missing data, noise, and inconsistent formats
- Trains classification/regression models on preprocessed data and outputs results  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
